Termentis (c) Bertrand Janin <tamentis@neopulsar.org>
=====================================================

Termentis (14)
    This font was designed for one purpose: fit three terminals on a
    1680 wide display without the loss of one pixel. To do so, my
    terminals are set with the following resource:

	XTerm*internalBorder: 0

    This font is heavily inspired from the Terminus font and the work of
    Autun Ytterdal (ay@linpro.net) and is licensed under the same GPLv2
    license.

Termentis (12)
    This font is designed to be as less wide as possible but still readable
    by being taller. As much as I wanted to keep the spirit of the above, it
    is obviously different. It was also designed to fit on a 1680, but now 
    you can fit 4 terminals! (You better have good eyes)

Notes
    I designed it working on a Unicode machine, I never tried it on
    latin1, if you are willing to make it work on a wider range of
    encodings, feel free to send me a patch. Also feel free to complete
    the Unicode set, I only use english and french characters.

    I used gbdfed to create and update this font.
