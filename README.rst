Termentis (12)
--------------
This font is designed to be as less wide as possible but still readable by
being taller. As much as I wanted to keep the spirit of the above, it is
obviously different. It was also designed to fit on a 1680, but now you can fit
4 terminals! (You better have good eyes)

Termentis (14)
--------------
This font was designed for one purpose: fit three terminals on a 1680 wide
display without the loss of one pixel. To do so, my terminals are set with the
following resource::

    XTerm*internalBorder: 0

This font is heavily inspired from the Terminus font and the work of Autun
Ytterdal (ay@linpro.net) and is licensed under the same GPLv2 license.

Termentis (24)
--------------
This font uses Terminus 24 at its base, the glyphs were cropped to 24x10 and
most glyphs from the first pages are replaced by higher resolution versions of
Termentis 12.

Notes
-----
I designed it working on a Unicode machine, I never tried it on latin1, if you
are willing to make it work on a wider range of encodings, feel free to send me
a patch. Also feel free to complete the Unicode set, I only use english and
french characters.

I used gbdfed to create and update this font.
